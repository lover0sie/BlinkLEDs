# BlinkLEDs

This is a program written as C++ in Arduino IDE where the two LEDs blinked at random intervals and the Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) is used to count the number of blinks of each LED every 60 seconds. The number of counts is displayed using 7-segment LED displays and the data is manually exported to Excel to be plotted as a bar graph. 

Note: Please use Arduino IDE to run the program. In order to run the program successfully, please connect the circuit according to the code. I have added notes in the code for you to help you understand the code.
